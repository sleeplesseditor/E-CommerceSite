# CRWNClothingSite

A large-scale e-commerce app for a clothing store, built using React (including Hooks), Redux, ContextAPI, GraphQL, Stripe, and Firebase, following [Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang's Udemy course](https://udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/14915234#overview)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Variants of the project which use GraphQL or ContextAPI will be updated on separate branches. 

The project is live on [Heroku](https://crwn-live-uk.herokuapp.com/);
